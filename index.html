        <h2 style="text-align:center; font-weight:400;">for srasta</h2>
        <p>
          hi srasta,<br><br>
          i don’t really know where to start. maybe i just missed you a little more today than usual. maybe i just wanted to put a small piece of how i feel somewhere that feels real.<br><br>
          it’s been two years. wild, right? time keeps moving.<br><br>
          you still come up in the quiet moments. not loudly. not painfully. just... gently. aba maybe when i am happy or when i accomplish something and i dont have you to share it with, or when someone laughs in a way that sounds like you used to...<br><br>
          i don’t want anything. i’m not trying to change the story. i just wanted to say: you really mattered to me. deeply. beautifully. and a huge part of me has been always carrying you around regardless of if im very happy or sad <br> deep down, i still read your letters...<br><br>
          i hope you’re okay. i hope you’re laughing often. and i hope you still walk like the world’s your own little movie...<br><br>
          every time i discover new songs on spotify, i remember how much i loved sharing them with you.<br>
          every time i think of kathmandu and miss you, i make spinach and feta ravioli and listen to prateek kuhad (seriously—can you believe it? prateek kuhad and me haha).<br>
          it's funny to me how now i’m a crazy matcha drinker even though we never drank it together. somehow, when i do, it feels like i’m drinking it with you.<br>
          every time i buy something and mess up the size, i still think of how thusking you would be when i got your shoe size wrong.<br>
          every time i’ve failed, i think of how you believed in me. the more i grow, the more i realize how proud i am of the person you are...<br>
	  you can accomplish all your goals srasta, you are genuinely the kindest person i have ever welcomed in my life, and in the end as we live, this is what makes me respect you even more <br>
          and every time i’m at my lowest, i still ask myself—where did potey come from?<br><br>
          this little corner of the internet is just my way of saying: thank you. for being you. for being part of my story.<br><br>
